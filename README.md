Reaction Time Game
Overview
The Reaction Time Game is a fun, interactive game created using the Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT. The game tests and measures the player's reaction time using the Sense HAT's joystick and LED matrix. When the joystick is pressed, a random pixel on the LED matrix lights up, and the player must press the joystick button as quickly as possible to stop the timer and record their reaction time.
